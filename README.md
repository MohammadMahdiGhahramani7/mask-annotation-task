# Video Mask Annotation
A significant amount of human effort is required to
manually annotate video segmentation datasets, so reduc-
ing human annotation costs is a major research focus.
Annotating video clips creates training data by labelling,
tagging, and tagging information inside videos. Using
this training data, computer vision models are trained for
identifying and detecting objects. In order to speed up the
annotation procedure, semi-automatic or automatic meth-
ods must be formulated. Annotating an object in a few
frames and then exploiting a method that keeps track of
the object in subsequent frames is how we annotate the
entire video. A review of the most recent efforts in this
area is presented, followed by an evaluation of the most
appropriate one to use for a given dataset.

As part of machine learning, annotations are used to la-
bel and categorize data. Regarding this, video annotation is
used to teach computers how to recognize objects or situa-
tions. This technology involves adding labels or masks to
video data to train AI computer vision models. This can be
done manually or, to a certain degree, automatically. The
labels can be anything from simple identification of objects
to distinguishing complex actions and emotions. An im-
age sequence is essentially what a video is. But annotating
them as videos, and not just individual frames, will pro-
vide more contextual information for our models. The first
advantage of this is the capability of interpolaiting, mean-
ing that we can annotate the beginning and end of your se-
quence and then it automatically creates the annotations in
between. The ability to exploit temporal context, access to
better data for training AI models, and having more real-
world applications are other benefits of working with video.
While there are many advantages of annotating videos over
images, the process is still a time-consuming and complex
task.

Concerning the most common techniques used to per-
form video mask annotation, we can point out bounding boxes, polygons, keypoints and 3D cuboids. The simplest
form of annotation is a bounding box. It is a rectangular
box that surrounds an object in a frame. A polygon is a
closed figure that is made up of a set of connected line seg-
ments, being useful to annotate objects that have irregular
form. Keypoints, on the other hand, are great for marking
arrays of essential points that we want to track. Eventually,
3D cuboids are useful for annotating objects that have a 3D
structure, such as vehicles, houses, or furniture. Figure1
shows how these techniques are applied.
